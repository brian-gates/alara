Stained and polished wooden cabinetry line the walls. A soft rug covers most of the room. The chairs are upholstered with soft leathers and furs. A large desk with gold embroidery dominates the center of the room.

[[Ladris Amblecrown]] is usually behind the desk doing work. He usually has two [[Veteran]] guards nearby.
