title: Metatext
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

It is said that [[Deneir]], a servant of [[Oghma]] the Binder, first achieved his position among the deities by glimpsing the merest portion of this text, and that the need to read the entire work gives him purpose. [[Deneir]] believes that the Metatext is reflected in the [[Prime Plane]] through snippets of every written work ever committed to paper. A word here, a juxtaposition of letters there, and (rarely) even entire sentences of particularly enlightened writing echo the ideal work.
