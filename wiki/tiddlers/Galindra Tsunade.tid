Duchess of [[House Tsunade]]

It is rumored that Galindra fell overboard of her late father's ship when she was only 2 years old, but managed to swim 3 miles back to shore. Tales also suggest that she had help from some sea creatures that she became companions with. Either way, Galindra's love of the ocean has suited her well as the leader of [[House Tsunade]]. Her enormous Galleon serves as the flagship for the navy of [[Silyndar]] and she is more at home with a bunch of sailors and pirates than with Elven nobility.
