When I was a child, a great storm hit my village and caused massive destruction. Our family home was destroyed. My mother was killed by lightning while trying to get my half-siblings and I to safety. After the storm, my siblings and I moved to a town along the coast and survived by working on fishing boats. When I was 17, a hurricane leveled the town and killed my 2 older half-brothers. A man dressed in black robes came to the town and approached my younger half-sister and I. He taught us about the mighty Talos and his destructive power. He said that Talos must favor us since we have survived so many hardships. We decided to join the Cult of Talos and spent the next 10 years in his service, constantly praying and preaching his might. A year ago, a huge earthquake leveled the monastery. I was the only survivor. Since losing my family I been roaming the world trying to please Talos and bring more worshippers into his favor.
