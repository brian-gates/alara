Duke of [[House Hawkeye]]

A sturdy elf who runs the spy network for [[Silyndar]]. Always has an ear open for rumors, and since he's got elven ears, he hears more than is intended for him to hear. Rumor has it that Valenos is the best Archer in [[Silyndar]], but he rarely shoots for anyone to be able to verify the rumor.
