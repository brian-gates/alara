This estate is large, lavish, and heavily guarded.  Massive stone walls surround the complex and orc guards patrol the premises.  A polished stone path leads from the main gate through a courtyard that is lushly hedged and contains a bubbling fountain and several statues.  Marble stairs lead to a columned veranda and two massive doors.
