Duke of [[House Aeris]]

A pretentious and arrogant Duke. Flexes his power and the longevity of [[House Aeris]] to excel at the politics of [[Qeynos]]. Always playing a chess game with resources and Vaelis is always reminding others that his bloodline is believed to be the descendants of the ancient Kingship.
