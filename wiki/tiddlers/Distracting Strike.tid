type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attackâ€™s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.
