Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:

* You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.
* Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesnâ€™t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
* When you use the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a loaded hand crossbow you are holding.
