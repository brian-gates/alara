description: Plain, flower-child-looking, weathered, middle-aged woman who listens more than speaks.  The wrinkles around her eyes are warm.
ethic: Neutral

title: Kayla
traits: Iâ€™ve been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.  The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom.
