Massive brawler that likes to frequent eastern [[The Gray]] inns, like the [[Savory Steak]].  Bears many scars from his frequent participation in the [[Arena]].

He is very belligerent but fighting him will result in earning his respect.

He sometimes works with [[Jaoquin]] who arranges "accidents" to some of his opponents.

Dies in the Arena within a few days of the adventurers arrival.
