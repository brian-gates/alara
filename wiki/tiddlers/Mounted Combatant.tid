You are a dangerous foe to face while mounted. While you are mounted and arenâ€™t incapacitated, you gain the following benefits:

* You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount. 
* You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.
* If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half dam- age, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
